# GreatApeDictionary2.0
A human version of our Great Ape Dictionary experiment!

In this paper we take a linguistics approach and probe the question of whether interactive, discourse-managing gestures in humans can be traced to directive gestures in chimpanzeeas as part of a potentially universal gestural inventory shared throughout the family of great apes. We carried out two experiments (n=300 each) in which we tested (i) whether human participants would infer the same meanings that are attested in chimpanzees for chimpanzee gestures performed by a human gesturer; and (ii) whether human participants would infer gestures' meanings that derive from the chimpanzee meanings by virtue of a conduit metaphor.
